-- Rows in fzPartOf are at the same time instances of
-- class fzObject. That's why fzObject column is a primary key
-- and at the same time is a FK to fzObject table. When you want to
-- create a row in fzPartOf you should first create a row in fzObject.
-- And then you should link fzPartOf and fzObject.
--
-- That will give the ability to work with links between objects
-- the same way as you work with objects (trace versions, approve, baseline, etc.)
