-- Every object from fzObject may have an unlimited number of
-- snapshots. Every snapshot is a version of the object edited by some
-- particular user (or by anonymous user). Every snapshot has a version,
-- list of PHP-class properties and values (in associative array),
-- and date/time information.
--
-- When you want to change the object, you just create a new snapshot,
-- link it with the object and gives it a version which is bigger than
-- all previous versions.
