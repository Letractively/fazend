#summary How to unit-test fazend itself
#labels Phase-Support

= Prerequisites =

To test FaZend framework you should have installed:

 * [http://phing.info/docs/guide/current/ phing]
 * [http://www.phpunit.de/ phpUnit 2+]
 * [http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-sqlite.php Pdo_sqlite] PHP extension

= Running tests =

Checkout the latest version of FaZend into something like `/home/john/dev/fazend` and then do this:

{{{
cd /home/john/dev/fazend
phing test
}}}

You should see something like this:

{{{
Buildfile: D:\dev\fazend\build.xml

fazend tests > test:

 [phpunit2] Testsuite: FaZend_Auth_Adapter_Http_Resolver_AdminsTest
 [phpunit2] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Incomplete: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.45559 s

== How it works? ==

Phing finds all files located in `/test/FaZend` directory, which are named like `*Test.php`. Every file is inherited from `/test/AbstractTestCase.php`. Every test when started emulate the execution of a real application. The application is located in `/test/test-application`.

One test is testing one class and is named by the name of that class. For example `EmailTest.php` contains a class `FaZend_EmailTest`, which tests class `FaZend_Email`.
