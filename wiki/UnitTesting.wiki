#summary How to unit-test fazend itself
#labels Phase-Support

= Prerequisites =

To test FaZend framework you should have installed:

 * [http://phing.info/docs/guide/current/ phing]
 * [http://www.phpunit.de/ phpUnit 2+]
 * [http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-sqlite.php Pdo_sqlite] PHP extension

You should be familiar with these concepts:

 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing Unit Testing]
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development TDD]
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration Continuous Integration]

= Running tests =

Checkout the latest version of FaZend into something like `/home/john/dev/fazend`. Then checkout the latest version of Zend into `/home/john/dev/zend-trunk`. Then do this:

{{{
cd /home/john/dev/fazend
phing test
}}}

You should see something like this:

{{{
Buildfile: D:\dev\fazend\build.xml

fazend tests > test:

 [phpunit2] Testsuite: FaZend_Auth_Adapter_Http_Resolver_AdminsTest
 [phpunit2] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Incomplete: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.45559 s
 [phpunit2] Test: FaZend_Auth_Adapter_Http_Resolver_AdminsTest, Run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Incomplete: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.45579 s

Every time you make any change to the source code you should run `phing test` on your computer to make sure you didn't break the other code. 

And every time you add new functionality make sure that you add a unit-test, that tests this particular functionality. In this case you will be sure that nobody else can break the functionality you created.

== How it works? ==

Phing finds all files located in `/test/FaZend` directory, which are named like `*Test.php`. Every file is inherited from `/test/AbstractTestCase.php`. Every test, when is being started, emulates the execution of a real application. This "real" application itself is located in `/test/test-application`.

One particular test is testing one class and is named by the name of that class. For example `EmailTest.php` contains a class `FaZend_EmailTest`, which tests class `FaZend_Email`.
