= Example usage of AjaxCall view helper =

This is a sample view script:

{{{
<p>The status of file system is: <?=$this->ajaxCall($this->url(array(), 'status', true))?></p>
}}}

This is a method in a controller in the "status" route:

{{{
/**
 * Calculates the status and returns is in JSON (time consuming operation)
 *
 * @return void
 */
function statusAction() {
    $this->_returnJSON("OK");
}
}}}

You will see OK after a dynamic AJAX call. Simple and easy.
