= Example usage of AjaxCall view helper =

This is a sample view script:

{{{
<p>The status of file system is: 
<?=$this->ajaxCall()
  ->setUrl($this->url(array(), 'status', true)) // this URL will be called
  ->setImmediateExecution() // immediately call the URL or after a user mouse-click
  ->setTitle('click to load status report') // 'title' attribute for the tag
  ->setTag('span') // the tag to use (a, span, div, etc..)
  ->setMessage('loading...') // this message to be shown before loading
?></p>
}}}

This is a method in a controller in the "status" route:

{{{
/**
 * Calculates the status and returns is in JSON
 *
 * We assume that this is a time consuming operation, that should be executed
 * only after a user clicks the DIV or maybe automatically after the page is loaded.
 *
 * @return void
 */
function statusAction() {
    $this->_returnJSON("OK");
}
}}}

You will see OK after a dynamic AJAX call. Simple and easy.
