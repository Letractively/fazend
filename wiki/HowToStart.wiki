= Configuration of Repository =

Your project structure should be like this (full example in /directory-structure):

{{{
/projectName
  /branches
  /tags
  /trunk
    /php
      build.properties
      build.xml
      /src
        /application
        /library
        /public
}}}

Then do this (`vi` on Linux machine, `notepad` on Windows):

{{{
svn propedit svn:externals ProjectName/trunk/php/src/library --editor-cmd=vi
}}}

In the file opened for edit add these two lines:

{{{
Zend http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend
FaZend http://fazend.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/FaZend
}}}

Save the file and do this:

{{{
svn commit projectName -m "svn:externals properly set"
}}}

From now on the directory `/library` will have two subdirectories: `Zend` and `FaZend`, which will updated automatically from other repositories every time you `svn update` your project. The benefits you get:

 * Your repository is not flooded with "not your" files
 * Your repository is small enough, just your application files
 * You always have the latest version of Zend and FaZend

= Starting a new project =

Key steps for a new project setup:

  # Create fazend.com account
  # Create new project in fazend.com
  # Configure access to SVN
  # Create repository structure in SVN (as in the example)
  # Setup Google Analytics and configure it in `app.ini`
  # Setup Google Webmasters and verify it
  # configure files in your project: `build.properties`, `app.ini`, `backup.ini`

= Local Configuration =

Add this line to your apache `httpd.conf` file and restart apache:

{{{
<Directory /_path_to_your_project_/php/src/public>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes
    SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV development
    Allow from all
    AllowOverride None
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php [L]
    RewriteBase /project
</Directory>

Alias /project "/_path_to_your_project_/php/src/public"
}}}

Now this link should work: `http://localhost/project`.
