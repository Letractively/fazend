#summary Now you can baseline your concepts in architecture and design

= Synopsis =

You have some architecture and design concepts, that you want to stay in your code no matter what. There are many people in the project team and you can't control what each of them will do later with your code. When you're an architect, you want to implement some architecture concepts and rest assured that they are not compromised later.

The scenario:

 1. You declare your concepts right inside the code by means of docBlock tag `@baseline`
 1. You run a unit test creator that collects all baseline tags and creates an XML snapshot
 1. You add this snapshot to the project

= Usage Sample =

This is your class:

{{{
/**
 * One simple graphic image in the system
 * @baseline me@example.com exists()
 */
class Model_Image {
    //...
}
}}}

When you're creating this class you want to be sure that *never* during the lifecycle of the project it could be removed from the code, no matter what other programmers decide to do. You use `@baseline` construct, as shown above.

Then you make a snapshot:

{{{
$ php index.php Baseliner --email=me@example.com
………
unit test successfully created, 28 baseline instructions found and documented
file saved: ../tests/baseliner/me@example.com.xml
}}}

New snapshot is created and added to the project repository. Now either all your baseline instructions are valid or the unit test fails.

= Full Reference of `@baseline` =

The format is simple:

{{{
@baseline <email> <method> ([<params>]) [<comment>]
}}}
