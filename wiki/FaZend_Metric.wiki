{{{
class SomeClass {
  function getBigValue($param) {
    // very slow and resource consuming method...
    return $data;
  }

  function getItFast() {
    return FaZend_Metric::create()
      ->setMethod('getBigValue') // name of the method, it should be public
      ->setClass($this) // call the method in this class
      ->setArgument('param', 13) // $param will be equal to 13
      ->calculate(); // prepares for calculation
  }
}
}}}

You can delete rowset of metrics:

{{{
FaZend_Metric::deleteByRegexp('/BigValue/'); // actual metric name is 'SomeClass::getBigValue'
}}}

You can setup your own environment proxy. This class is responsible for collecting environment data from other classes, when metric is created or analyzed.

{{{
FaZend_Metric::setProxy(new FaZend_Metric_Proxy());
}}}

While metric is calculated you can indicate that it depends on some resource:

{{{
FaZend_Metric::dependsOn('system file');
}}}

And later you can destroy all metrics by resource name:

{{{
FaZend_Metric::deleteByResource('system file');
}}}

There is a function for system time calculating, which automatically connects the metric to current time and destroys the metric when time arrives:

{{{
$time = FaZend_Metric::time(60 * 60); // destroy it in 1 hour (24 hours by default)
}}}

== Technical spec ==

The class automatically creates three tables in the DB: fz_metric, fz_source, fz_dependency. If the tables already exist and their schema differs from the required - Fazend automatically drops the tables and create new ones.
