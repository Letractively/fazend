#summary How `FaZend_POS` is implemented
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Database Schema =

There are 4 tables in the database (SQL available at `FaZend/POS/database/*.sql`):

 * `fzObject`: collection of all persistent objects
 * `fzPartOf`: collection of _part-of_ relations between objects
 * `fzSnapshot`: collection of momentary values of objects
 * `fzApproval`: collection of approval requests

We *never* delete or update any records in these tables. We may only add new records. We _may_ delete only to remove some history, some expired records from `fzSnapshot` table. Other tables get only `INSERT` operations, never `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.

We may also sometimes perform a _garbage collection_, by means of selecting all classes from `fzObject.class` column and trying to instantiate them in PHP. Maybe some of them are from previous versions of the application and are no longer valid. In this case we *may* remove the objects from the database.

= Sample Scenarios =

== Creating a New Object ==

You do this in PHP:

{{{
$root = FaZend_POS::root();
$root->cars = new FaZend_POS_Array();
}}}

The database gets this data:

{{{
fzObject {id: 1, class: 'FaZend_POS_Array'}
fzObject {id: 2, class: 'FaZend_POS_PartOf'}
fzPartOf {id: 1, name: 'cars', fzObject: 2, parent: NULL, child: 1}
}}}

While the object is created we just create a new record in `fzObject` and save no data into `fzSnapshot`. Since the class `FaZend_POS_Array` doesn't have any PHP properties encapsulated. Object id is `1`, object class is `FaZend_POS_Array`.

Object `FaZend_POS::root()` has no instance in `fzObject` table, it is just a representative of the entire object storage. That's why `parent` in `NULL` in the relationship record.

== Building Relations Between Objects ==

Now we need to set a _part-of_ relation between objects, in PHP code:

{{{
$bmw = new Car();
$root->cars['my car'] = $bmw;
}}}

In database:

{{{
fzObject {id: 3, class: 'Car'}
fzObject {id: 4, class: 'FaZend_POS_PartOf'}
fzPartOf {id: 1, name: 'my car', fzObject: 4, parent: 2, child: 3}
}}}

As you see, two new objects are created in `fzObject`: `#3` and `#3`. Object `#4` is a relationship between object `#1` (`FaZend_POS_Array`) and #3 (`Car`). To add this information to the relationship we create a record in `fzPartOf` table, where we give a name to this relationship (`my car`), link it to the relationship-object (`#4`) and set necessary links to the parent (`FaZend_POS_Array`) and child objects (`Car`).

== Setting Static PHP Properties of Objects ==

In PHP:

{{{
$bmw->color = 'black';
$bwm->model = 'bmw';
}}}

In database:

{{{
fzSnapshot {id: 1, 
    fzObject: 3, 
    version: 1, 
    properties: {color: 'black', model: 'bmw'},
    alive: 1,
    updated: '15-July-2009',
    user: NULL,
    comment: '',
    baselined: NULL}
}}}

When we change an object in PHP, we should reflect these changes in the database. Every change has a record in `fzSnapshot` table. Every record in this table has information _comparing_ to the previous snapshot. In the example above we didn't have any snapshots before, that's why the first one will have full list of properties (`{color: 'black', model: 'bmw'}`).

The snapshot record has a link to the object (`fzObject: 3`) and the number of version of this snapshot (`version: 1`). Versions are numbered from `1` to infinity. Every next snapshot gets a version one-bigger than the previous one.

Alive-flag (`alive: 1`) tells that this snapshot has an object which is not deleted yet. If the object has to be deleted we just create a next snapshot where this flag we set to `false`. That's how we _delete_ objects from the storage. If you want to wipe the object out, together with its entire history and all links to it, you should use `ps()->wipe()` method, which will delete a record from `fzObject` table, together with snapshots, links and approval requests - it's a dangerous operation.

== Changing Relations Between Objects ==

In PHP:

{{{
$audi = new Car();
$root->cars['my car'] = $audi;
}}}

In database:

{{{
fzObject {id: 5, class: 'Car'}
fzObject {id: 6, class: 'FaZend_POS_PartOf'}
fzPartOf {id: 2, name: 'my car', fzObject: 6, parent: 1, child: 5}
fzSnapshot {id: 2, fzObject: 4, version: 1, alive: 0, ...}
}}}

== Changing Static PHP Properties of Objects ==

In PHP:

{{{
$bmw->color = 'blue';
}}}

In database:

{{{
fzSnapshot {id: 3, 
    fzObject: 3, 
    version: 2, 
    properties: {color: 'blue'}, ...}
}}}
