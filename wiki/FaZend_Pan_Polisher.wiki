#summary Automated code polisher

= Scenario of Usage =

You should create a file `LICENSE.txt` in `/project_root/trunk/php/LICENSE.txt`, which should have one first line and a paragraph of text. This text will be automatically inserted into every `PHP`, `CSS`, `PHTML` files.

Then you go with this:

{{{
$ cd php/src/public
$ php index.php Polish --dry-run
}}}

Read the log. When you're happy with what you see, remove the `--dry-run' parameter and make real changes to the code. Polisher makes the following changes to the code:

 * Converts TAB-s into 4 spaces
 * Injects LICENSE.txt into docBlocks

We're planning to integrate `PHP_Beautifier` here, in order to enable the following changes:

 * To enforce Kernigan&Richie style of curled braces
 * To enforce an existence of phpDoc blocks for every method, class and file
 * To enforce proper indentation
